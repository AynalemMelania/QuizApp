# QuizApp

This is an app with some literature questions

If you want to try this app it's free. The photos are not my creation but I didn't use them in commercial scopes . This is just a demo app 
How to make the code work:

you run the app from your computer using Android Studio/Eclipse
you can use an emulator or a real device (preferably Android 4.4 Kitkat, but you can make some changes to make it work on others devices)
the questions are very easy just to see how the screens are created, how the Views are disposed.
I used different Views 
For errors or question please write an issue or a comment How the app work:
After you run the app, read every question
At some questions just an only reponse is true, but there is one with multiple answer
If you reponse right at all the questions, you will receive the maximum of 6 points
All the messages will appear on the screen after every change you make (write a text, choose)
After you finish them and push  the Submit button the app will start again
